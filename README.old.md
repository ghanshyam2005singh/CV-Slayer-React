# ü©∏ CV Slayer üòà ‚Äî Brutally Honest Resume Roaster

CV Slayer is not your typical resume reviewer. It's the dark-humored, brutally honest, slightly unhinged HR you never wanted to meet... but probably needed to. Choose how hard you want to get roasted ‚Äî from ‚ÄúPyar Se üíò‚Äù to ‚ÄúDhang Se üò°‚Äù ‚Äî and watch your resume get shredded with style (and swears üò¨).

lets debug this and make it better, there is lots of problem i am telling you about the application and also some issue and then we will go every pages one by one and update the whole page accordingly, i said one by one page and all the page, till i said stop.

about the application: this application where user came and upload their resume and select the preferences given in option, you can checkout otions frm app.js and when he click on button for roast gemini will analysis the document and store the all the information from document with knowing user, and give him feedback roast other things score based on document and preferences and the data will be store in mongodb atlas and when only admin go to admin rount and login with email pssword he can see the resume the has been store in mongodb and all the information, i said all name mail number etc etc all and admin can delete and view the resume from admin panel. thats all

issue:1. data isn not storing and fetching properly like time and details
3. better ui of navbar, that toogle button
4. use env file instead of directly coded email and other important data
5. fix linting, npm run build issue, remove console.log and other sesitive data leaking
instead of localhost or development, make it for production and better
6. make it mobile responsive
7. can see all the details and delete the resume
8. giving window alert when click on analyse other resume
9. etc if you think any improvement but donot change our concept

again i am saying remeber this, we will go every pages one by one and improve it.
