# ü©∏ CV Slayer üòà ‚Äî Brutally Honest Resume Roaster

CV Slayer is not your typical resume reviewer. It's the dark-humored, brutally honest, slightly unhinged HR you never wanted to meet... but probably needed to. Choose how hard you want to get roasted ‚Äî from ‚ÄúPyar Se üíò‚Äù to ‚ÄúDhang Se üò°‚Äù ‚Äî and watch your resume get shredded with style (and swears üò¨).

Hey there! Let me take a loving look at your resume...

First off, kudos for tackling a real-world problem! Your AlumConnect pitch deck is bursting with potential ‚Äì it&#x27;s like a delicious entrepreneurial souffl√©, light, airy, and full of promise. However, as a resume, it&#x27;s more of a culinary masterpiece that needs a little‚Ä¶ plating. Right now, it reads like a fantastic business plan, not a personal resume. We need to showcase *you*, the brilliant mind behind this innovative platform. Think of it this way: your AlumConnect idea is the main course, but we need to add some appetizers (your skills and experience) and a delightful dessert (your personal achievements) to complete the meal.

The problem statement is spot-on ‚Äì the disconnect between academia and industry is a real beast! But instead of just stating the problem, subtly weave your own relevant experiences into the solution. For example, did you notice a lack of mentorship during your own studies? Did that inspire AlumConnect? Let&#x27;s hear those personal anecdotes! Also, while the features are great, they&#x27;re presented like a laundry list. Instead, highlight *your* role in developing or envisioning these features. Did *you* design the AI matching algorithm? Did *you* lead the team that built the forum functionality? Let your contributions shine!

The &quot;Why Now&quot; section is a strong point ‚Äì it clearly articulates the market opportunity. However, remember that this is your resume, not a market research report. Instead of just listing reasons, connect those reasons to *your* skills and ambitions. For instance, &quot;My passion for connecting students with industry leaders, coupled with the boom in India&#x27;s infrastructure sector, led me to develop AlumConnect.&quot; See? Much more personal and engaging.

Finally, my friend, this isn&#x27;t a pitch deck ‚Äì it&#x27;s a resume. We need to add some personal details, your contact information (where are you hiding?), and idea
giving response like this and why always 75/100
